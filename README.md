### Learning AI/ML
  - Beginner
    - [AI For Everyone](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/ai-for-everyone/)
  - Online Courses
    - [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)
    - Microsoft's [ML For Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners) & [Data Science for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners) & [Generative AI for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners/)
      - A series of self-guided learnings offered by Microsoft that provide a solid intro to ML/DS/Gen AI.
    - [Andrew Ng Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/machine-learning-specialization/)
    - [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/)
    - [Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai/)
      - [Book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9781492045519/)
    - [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/)

    - [i.am.ai AI Expert Roadmap](https://i.am.ai/roadmap)
      - A path for learning AI that covers the major groupings in learning AI. A good way to get a good overview of many of the skills needed in ML, though many of the resources are more for getting your feet wet than learning in depth.
    - [Applied ML](https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml)
      - A curated list of articles, papers, and blogs on how to apply ML in production
  - Reinforcement Learning
    - [RL Book](https://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)
      - Generally considered the first RL book everyone should read. The authors are two of the luminaries in the field who teach just as well.
    - [Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning)
      - This is a Coursera specialization based on their book that provides a guided learning experience
  - Online Masters
    - There are a number of <$20,000 online Masters out there that provide an in-depth education in AI/ML. These can provide you with a new network to tap into and something you can achieve while working.
